# vsc-vyos-syntax
Syntax highlighting for vyos in Visual Studio Code and VSCodium forked from [Junos Syntax](https://github.com/woodjme/vscode-junos-syntax).

## Limitations
Support for configuration command syntax is stable, the configuration tree format is currently under development

## Thank you
To all the heavy lifting done by [Jamie Wood](https://github.com/woodjme), it provided a great place to fork from to support the vyos and edgeos syntax.
